# Master Thesis 2023

This is the final code for the master thesis: How does market coupling impact day ahead prices in NO2 with an increasing share of variable renewable energy sources?

The analysis is done in Rstudio using the Rmarkdown format. Data is not included since some is not publicly available and therefore cant be shared. API keys are also hidden.

The document contains a total of 2800 lines of code which includes data importing and processing, descriptive statistics, empirical model and result. Note that we have imported a lot more data than we have used due to an extensive exploration process. Therefore, the final dataset contains 90 variables but not all are used in the model.
